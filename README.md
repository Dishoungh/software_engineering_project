What're doing so far is looking good. We are now in Stage III. Below is our next milestone goals and assigned roles:

Next Milestones:
- Fix Bullet Speed: Sometimes the bullets go so fast that they phase through the zombies. We shall work on setting a constant speed for the bullets regardless of direction. The bullets seem to be dependent on how far away the mouse is from the player (the further the faster). 

- Adjust Map's Position and Re-scale: I think that at this point, we should only aim for making one giant map instead of making multiple maps. Let's make this one map big though. From the last test, the camera was set out of bounds and from the map and it wouldn't be on the player. Either adjust the map or adjust the camera, or both. Clicking to shoot also caused out of bounds errors.

- Skin Player and Zombies: We should now focus on making character models for the zombies and player and make them able to rotate in accordance to movement if we can.
	
- Make the zombies now move around and hunt for the player: Zombies should now move around in this stage. But no health or ammo yet (zombies nor player shouldn't die yet). We'll save that for next stage.

- Add Music: Due to request, we have decided we will add music to the game. If we are going to add music, we need to put music in the game by this stage.

Stage III Ends on November 15, 2019
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've checked the schedule that we've created and we're just slightly behind. That's okay. Not much we're behind on anyway. I think we're still looking good as far as development is concerned. I'll just go ahead and update the schedule in here instead of sending an email to everyone.

On November 1st, we were supposed to "kill zombies (delete the zombies when dead)" and develop player attributes such as ammo, health, and lives. We'll work on those later. 

For now in Stage III, we will fix the bullet velocity, adjust or remake the map, move the zombies, and skin the player/zombies (November 1-15). 

After that, I think we should then add the player attributes (health, ammo, lives), add a menu when the player dies (after all lives are used) asking if the user wishes to restart or exit the game, add powerups that will alter the player, zombies, or the gameplay, and add different weapons. As what powerups and weapons, we'll discuss that next meeting. This will be Stage IV (November 15-22).

Then for Stage V (November 22-25), we will make finishing touches and optimize the game and make absolutely sure the game works no matter what device it's in. We'll discuss on the Discord what we'll do for the presentation, discuss what we'll put into our report, and other things to make sure we're ready for demonstration. November 23rd will be our last meeting.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm just adding this in here early so I can just get it out of the way. I'll have to type this anyway. When Stage IV starts, at that point, we should fixed the bullet speed, adjusted/fixed the map, skin the player/zombies, made the players movie, and added music. This stage is the most important step for our game. Below is our next milestone and assigned roles:

Next Milestones:
- Add player and zombie attributes such as ammo and health: Zombies should die when shot down. We will discuss how much ammo each weapon will carry initially, how much health the player and each zombie object will have, and etc. 

- Add weapons (e.g. Assault Rifle, Shotgun, etc.) that behave differently than the Pistol. We will discuss what weapons we will add in the November 16th meeting. 

- Add a menu for the user after the player dies to either restart or quit the game. 

- Add powerups and/or ammo drops: There should be powerups that alter gameplay and/or ammo drops placed around the map that fills the player's ammo capacity. We will discuss where and how to design these elements in the November 16th meeting.

- Optional: Fix initial bullet location: There is a minor bug where when the player shoots, it doesn't synch with the bullet the player model is shooting. It follows direction, but not initial location.

- Optional: Add different difficulties that change the speed, damage of zombies, health, etc. 

- Optional: Have the game pause when the player wish to do so: When the player decides to press the pause key (escape or 'p' or whatever), the game should properly freeze and continue after pressing the pause key again. You can add a pause menu with options as well if you wish. Just pause the game and visibly show that the game is paused. 

- Optional: Reskin Block Objects

- Optional: Anything else: If there's anything that you feel we should add that would enhance the project, feel free to add it but make sure it works before Stage IV ends and make sure a core element is implemented beforehand. If it doesn't work by then, drop it because we will not have time to add any more stuff.


Roles:
	Add Player and Zombie Attributes:   ?
	Add Weapons:                        ?
	Add Powerups/Ammo Drops:            ?
	Add Death Menu:                     ?
	
Stage IV Ends on November 22, 2019
--------------------
Yeah, I know Stage IV is pretty big. There's so many ideas we can implement now to expand on our game. But, with the limited time we have at this point, I don't think we can do all of them. We will focus on implementing the core elements first. So, if any one of us decide to implement one of the above optional features, MAKE SURE YOU IMPLEMENT THE NON-CORE FEATURES FIRST. DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE OPTIONAL FEATURES AHEAD OF YOUR ASSIGNED FEATURE. We need these core features before Stage IV ends. It will be tempting to do this and this and that. If we have the time and we get these core elements implemented, go ahead but understand that we need to keep our expectations realistic and our schedules are getting tight now that the semester is getting close to its end.
