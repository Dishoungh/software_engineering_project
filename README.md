We are now in Stage IV, the most critical part for our game. This is where we will incorporate the core gameplay elements such as object attributes (ammo, health, maybe powerups, etc.), weapons, death menues, and powerups. There's a lot we can do here now to improve our game but we don't have much time left and more than likely, other classes that are going on are keeping our schedules tight. So, I will keep the scope of this stage as small or reasonably sized as possible. We will have a meeting this saturday (November 16) either on Discord or in the Acxiom Lab at JBHT at 1pm. Let everyone know if you think you'll make it to the meeting. In the meeting, we'll discuss the specifics of the features and things we will add into Stage IV.

Next Milestones:
- Add player and zombie attributes such as health: Zombies should die when shot down and player should die when health is 0.  

- Make finishing touches to the map and change camera values

- Add a menu for the user after the player dies to either restart or quit the game. 

- Have the game pause when the player wish to do so: When the player decides to press the pause key (escape or 'p' or whatever), the game should properly freeze and continue after pressing the pause key again. You can add a pause menu with options as well if you wish. Just pause the game and visibly show that the game is paused. 

- Optional: Add powerups and/or ammo drops: There should be powerups that alter gameplay and/or ammo drops placed around the map that fills the player's ammo capacity. We will discuss where and how to design these elements in the November 16th meeting.

- Optional: Fix initial bullet location: There is a minor bug where when the player shoots, it doesn't synch with the bullet the player model is shooting. It follows direction where the gun is pointing at but sometimes the bullet will at the top left of the player model.

- Optional: Add different difficulties that change the speed, damage of zombies, or health, etc. 

- Optional: Add weapons (e.g. Assault Rifle, Shotgun, etc.) that behave differently than the Pistol. Whatever weapons you choose to include needs to behave differently than the stock pistol. For example, shotguns should have a spread and Assult Rifles should maybe have a higher fire rate or damage output.

- Optional: Limited Ammo - Have the player have limited ammo for each weapon. If you choose to set a limit on ammo, it would be preferable to design ammo drop locations to refill ammo. 

- Optional: Anything else: If there's anything that you feel we should add that would enhance the project, feel free to add it but make sure it works before Stage IV ends and make sure a core element is implemented beforehand. If it doesn't work by then or the implementation compromises on the functionality of the game, drop it because we will not have time to add any more stuff during Stage V.

Stage IV Ends on November 22, 2019
--------------------
Stage IV is pretty big. There's so many ideas we can implement now to expand on our game. But, with the limited time we have at this point, I don't think we can do all of them. We will focus on implementing the core elements first. So, if any one of us decide to implement one of the above optional features, MAKE SURE YOU IMPLEMENT YOUR CORE FEATURES FIRST. DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE OPTIONAL FEATURES AHEAD OF YOUR ASSIGNED FEATURE. We need these core features before Stage IV ends. It will be tempting to do additional cool things for the game. If you have the time and your part implemented and working, go ahead but understand that we need to keep our scope realistic and I'm sure our other classes and other responsibilities are trying to keep us busy. Keep it short and sweet.
