What're doing so far is looking good. We are now in Stage III. Below is our next milestone goals and assigned roles:

Next Milestones:
- Fix Bullet Speed
	Sometimes the bullets go so fast that they phase through the zombies. We shall work on setting a constant speed for the bullets.
	The bullets seem to be dependent on how far away the mouse is from the player (the further the faster). 

- Adjust Map's Position and Re-scale
	I think that at this point, we should only aim for making one giant map instead of making multiple maps. Let's make this one map big though.
	From the last test, the camera was set out of bounds and from the map and it wouldn't be on the player. Either adjust the map or adjust the camera, or both.
	Clicking to shoot also caused out of bounds errors.

- Skin Player and Zombies
	We should now focus on making character models for the zombies and player and make them able to rotate in accordance to movement if we can.
	
- Make the zombies now move around and hunt for the player
	Zombies should now move around in this stage. But no health or ammo yet (zombies nor player should die yet). We'll save that for next stage.
