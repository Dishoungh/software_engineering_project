What're doing so far is looking good. We are now in Stage III. Below is our next milestone goals and assigned roles:

Next Milestones:
- Fix Bullet Speed:
	Sometimes the bullets go so fast that they phase through the zombies. We shall work on setting a constant speed for the bullets regardless of direction.
	The bullets seem to be dependent on how far away the mouse is from the player (the further the faster). 

- Adjust Map's Position and Re-scale:
	I think that at this point, we should only aim for making one giant map instead of making multiple maps. Let's make this one map big though.
	From the last test, the camera was set out of bounds and from the map and it wouldn't be on the player. Either adjust the map or adjust the camera, or both.
	Clicking to shoot also caused out of bounds errors.

- Skin Player and Zombies:
	We should now focus on making character models for the zombies and player and make them able to rotate in accordance to movement if we can.
	
- Make the zombies now move around and hunt for the player:
	Zombies should now move around in this stage. But no health or ammo yet (zombies nor player shouldn't die yet). We'll save that for next stage.

Stage III Ends on November 15, 2019
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've checked the schedule that we've created and we're just slightly behind. That's okay. Not much we're behind on anyway. I think we're still looking good as far as development is concerned. I'll just go ahead and update the schedule in here instead of sending an email to everyone.

On November 1st, we were supposed to "kill zombies (delete the zombies when dead)" and develop player attributes such as ammo, health, and lives. We'll work on those later. 

For now in Stage III, we will fix the bullet velocity, adjust or remake the map, move the zombies, and skin the player/zombies (November 1-15). 

After that, I think we should then add the player attributes (health, ammo, lives), add a menu when the player dies (after all lives are used) asking if the user wishes to restart or exit the game, add powerups that will alter the player, zombies, or the gameplay, and add different weapons. As what powerups and weapons, we'll discuss that next meeting. This will be Stage IV (November 15-22).

Then for Stage V (November 22-25), we will make finishing touches and optimize the game and make absolutely sure the game works no matter what device it's in. We'll discuss on the Discord what we'll do for the presentation, discuss what we'll put into our report, and other things to make sure we're ready for demonstration. November 23rd will be our last meeting.
