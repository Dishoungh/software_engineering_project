We are now in Stage IV, the most critical part for our game. This is where we will incorporate the core gameplay elements such as object attributes (health, maybe powerups, etc.), weapons, death menues, and a pause menu. There's a lot we can do here now to improve our game but we don't have much time left and more than likely, other classes that are going on are keeping our schedules tight. So, I will keep the scope of this stage as small or reasonably sized as possible. We will have a meeting this saturday (November 16) either on Discord or in the Acxiom Lab at JBHT at 1pm. Let everyone know if you think you'll make it to the meeting. In the meeting, we'll discuss the specifics of the features and things we will add into Stage IV.

Next Milestones:
- Add player and zombie attributes such as health: Zombies should die when shot down and player should die when health is 0.  

- Make finishing touches to the map and change camera values and have the game play music

- Add a menu for the user after the player dies to either restart or quit the game. 

Roles:
	
	Add Player and Zombie Attributes:      Dishoungh White

Stage IV Ends on November 22, 2019
