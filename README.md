We are now in the final stage of our Project (Stage V) before our demo next Tuesday. I've been a little worried about the lack of communication throughout this week. I understand we are all busy with other classes and responsibilities. I'm busy too. But we can't be absent like this on our final stretch of the project. For the next 3 days before our presentation day, we will (hopefully) all meet this Saturday November 23, 2019 at the Acxiom Lab at 1pm. If you would like to meet at any other time before Tuesday whether it be Sunday or Monday, I need to know as soon as possible. 

When we meet for the last time, we will spend our meeting testing our game, finding and documenting bugs. And we will make our diagrams and make our powerpoint and go over how we will present so our presentation will look good. If you have any questions or like to make changes 
	
Stage V Ends on November 26, 2019
